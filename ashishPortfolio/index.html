                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity with a strong foundation in both
                    programming and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical skill set bridges both security and development. I’m proficient in Python and Java,
                    with solid
                    knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have hands-on experience in frontend design, building
                    responsive interfaces, and delivering polished web experiences that balance aesthetics with
                    functionality.

                    I have hands-on skills in ethical
                    hacking, VAPT
                    (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing), and auditing, backed by deep knowledge of
                    cybersecurity methodologies.

                <p>
                    Currently working at Ecoquest Technologies, I’m involved in L1-level activities including debugging,
                    troubleshooting, and providing support for a real-time, full-stack Book Store application. The
                    project is built using Java Spring Boot and includes modules for book management, user orders, cart
                    systems, admin panel functionalities, and secure login authentication. My work ensures smooth system
                    performance and user experience while contributing to real-world development and security practices.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to grow into a dynamic role where I can innovate, build meaningful projects, and continue
                    evolving as a tech professional.
