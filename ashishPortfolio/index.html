                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity with a strong foundation in both
                    programming and security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical skill set bridges both security and development. I’m proficient in Java,
                    with solid
                    knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS. I have hands-on experience in frontend design, building
                    responsive interfaces, and delivering polished web experiences that balance aesthetics with
                    functionality.

                    I have hands-on skills in ethical
                    hacking, VAPT
                    (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing), and auditing, backed by deep knowledge of
                    cybersecurity methodologies.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Completed an Internship at Ecoquest Technologies,which gave me hands on experince on java basics, java core
                    and java advance concepts and secure coding practices.
